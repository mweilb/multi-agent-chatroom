# Overview
This prototype handles agent-based interactions in a conversational environment by integrating multiple AI agents. These agents work together to respond to user queries, execute tasks, and interact with one another.  

For more details on Semantic Kernel, Agents, and Orchestrators, please see the [Deeper on Semantic Kernel, Agents and Orchestrators](./thinking/overall.md) document.

## Core Features 

- **Multi-Agent Chat Room:** âœ… 
  A flexible chat environment where various agents interact with each other and the user. The system provides clear visibility into ongoing processes, enabling rapid iteration and efficient learning. It is designed not as a final product interface, but as a tool for those creating the experience

- **YAML Configuration:**  
  Each chat room is defined via a YAML configuration that specifies agent roles, instructions, selection criteria, termination conditions, and more.
    - **[Yaml Overview âœ…](./thinking/yaml.md):** 
-   - **[Yaml Samples âœ…](./thinking/yaml.md#samples):** 
- **Flexible Orchestration:**  
  Supports multiple orchestration strategies to manage how agents interact. In our prototype, weâ€™ve implemented custom orchestrations that include:
  - **[Agent Chat Orchestration (Sequential Flow) âœ…](./thinking/overall.md#agent-chat-orchestration):**  
    The orchestrator sequentially triggers agents one after the other, evaluating each output before moving on. This approach is ideal for iterative refinement.
  - **[Parallel Orchestration (ðŸš§)](./thinking/overall.md#parallel-orchestration):**  
    Multiple agents are activated concurrently, with their responses aggregated by the orchestrator. This reduces latency and offers redundancy.
  - **[Collaboration Orchestration (ðŸš§)](./thinking/overall.md#collaboration-orchestration):**  
    A hybrid strategy where a primary orchestrator handles structured inputs and a secondary orchestrator provides asynchronous, creative feedback.
  - **[Hierarchical Orchestrator-to-Orchestrator (ðŸš§)](./thinking/overall.md#hierarchical-orchestrator-to-orchestrator):**  
    A layered approach in which a primary orchestrator delegates tasks to subordinate orchestrators, each managing a group of specialized agents. Their aggregated outputs are then combined into a final response.

- **Service Integration:**  
  Easily switch between Ollama, Azure, or OpenAI, adapting to different deployment environments.
