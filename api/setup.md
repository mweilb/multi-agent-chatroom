2. **Configure Azure Cognitive Search**:
   - Add the following configuration to your `appsettings.json` or `.env` file:
   ```json
   {
       "AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT": "<Your Azure Cognitive Search Endpoint>",
       "AZURE_SEARCH_KEY": "<Your Azure Cognitive Search Key>"
   }
   ```

### **2.2 Set up Azure OpenAI**
