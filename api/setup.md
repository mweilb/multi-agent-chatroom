## **2. Azure Setup**

This system integrates with **Azure Cognitive Search** and **Azure OpenAI** services. Here’s how to set them up.

### **2.1 Set up Azure Cognitive Search**

   - Search for **Azure Cognitive Search** and create a new service.
   - Specify the necessary configurations like **name**, **subscription**, and **resource group**.
   - After creation, navigate to the **Keys** section and note down the **Search Endpoint** and **Search Key**.

2. **Configure Azure Cognitive Search**:
   - Add the following configuration to your `appsettings.json` or `.env` file:
   ```json
   {
       "AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT": "<Your Azure Cognitive Search Endpoint>",
       "AZURE_SEARCH_KEY": "<Your Azure Cognitive Search Key>"
   }
   ```

### **2.2 Set up Azure OpenAI**

1. **Create an Azure OpenAI Service**:
   - Go to **Azure OpenAI** in the Azure portal and create a new service.
   - Once created, obtain the **API Key** and **Endpoint** from the **Keys** section.

2. **Configure Azure OpenAI**:
   - Add the following settings to your `appsettings.json` or `.env` file:
   ```json
   {
       "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY": "<Your Azure OpenAI API Key>",
       "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT": "<Your Azure OpenAI Endpoint>",
       "AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT": "<Your Azure OpenAI Deployment Name>"
   }
   ```

### **2.3 Configure Azure in the Code**

Ensure that the `AzureKernelHelper` class is properly configured with the environment variables or configuration file details to allow the system to utilize **Azure OpenAI** and **Cognitive Search**.
